            "question":"Why would I use a Facebook ad agency rather than do it myself?",
            "answer": "PPC (Pay Per Click) advertising or, paid ads, refer to ads created to list in search engines. Google Ads is the leading PPC channel for most businesses’ digital marketing strategies. Google Ads is a well-established tool that has an industry built around it. Elaborate SaaS tools and PPC agencies are well developed because so many people turn to PPC to drive their business goals. The ability to advertise for almost any search query is a powerful tool as users turn to search engines first to answer their questions. In less than a few hours, and with enough budget, you can begin sending relevant traffic to your site.  This is helpful for time-sensitive initiatives such as a seasonal campaign, a product launch, or a company opening. In addition to sending traffic to your site, a well-planned PPC program will also improve the quality of your site. As your quality increases, so does your ‘quality score’. A high-quality score indicates a more competitive site and decreases your PPC costs!"

            "question":"What to expect from a great Facebook ad company",
            "answer": "When users have questions they turn to search engines to answer their questions.  The three channels that can be optimized to perform well in search are PPC, SEO, and Shopping. PPC uses Google Ads to create ads that are paid for to show at the best positions. Anyone with the will and the budget can earn traffic to their site in hours, if not minutes. This is a good option for time-sensitive traffic needs. An established PPC company, or PPC management agency, employs a myriad of strategies that can also be a reliable stream of traffic.SEO (Search Engine Optimization) on the other hand allows websites to rank in search engines for ‘free’. SEO is a long-term tactic that, when done correctly, will have lasting effects.  This too is an entire industry that has been built to develop competitive sites that have developed an authoritative niche in their industry."
